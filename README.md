Insurance Claim Prediction
This project predicts the likelihood that a person will file an insurance claim and estimates the potential claim amount using machine learning. The system takes user details (age, gender, BMI, number of dependents, smoking status, region, etc.), preprocesses the data, and uses Random Forest models for both classification and regression.

Features:
Predicts whether an insurance claim is likely.
Estimates the possible claim amount for high-risk users.
User-friendly command-line interface for quick input and instant predictions.
Handles data preprocessing, encoding, and scaling automatically.
Includes model evaluation metrics for accuracy and regression quality.

Technologies: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy
